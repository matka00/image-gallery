# Image Gallery

Image Gallery was a project during my studies to learn and practice
- how to do CRUD in Node
- how to upload images in JS
- http methods
- Swiper.js

Opening the page an image gallery shows up displayed by Swiper.js. New pictures can also be uploaded on the bottom of the page. After clicking on *upload* button, the new image immediately appears as the last one in the gallery. Pictures can also be deleted by clicking on the *bin* icon under them.

## Usage

1. Clone the project

2. Navigate into *backend* folder
```
cd backend
```

3. Install *dependencies* listed in package.json
```
npm install
```

4. Run *server.js* (in *backend* folder)
```
node server.js
```
